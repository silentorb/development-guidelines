# Web App Development Guidelines

## Tools

* React - Javascript Library created by Facebook

* React-Router - Declarative routing for React.

* Webpack - Module bundler which takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets by bundling them together based on some configuration

* Redux - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps

* Axios - Promise based HTTP client

* ECMAScript 6 (ES6)

* JSX


## Configuration

* Every project should have a ```config``` folder with configuration files.

* Config files must be either JSON or YAML, not code.

* Do not store server URL's directly into your requests.  Store them in a config file to easily change between dev and prod.


## Project Structure

```
